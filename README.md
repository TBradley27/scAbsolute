Measuring single-cell ploidy and cell cycle status in single-cell DNA sequencing data.
Please see the [manuscript](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-024-03204-y) for details.

This repository contains the source code for the *scAbsolute* software and scripts to replicate the figures in the manuscript.

In order to run the code, to see examples of how to use the package and an easy-to-use workflow, we recommend using the lab's [single-cell sequencing pipeline](https://github.com/markowetzlab/scDNAseq-workflow).
